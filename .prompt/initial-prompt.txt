Create a fully functional React timesheet app shell using modern UI design with glassmorphism, gradients, and smooth animations. Use Tailwind CSS for styling (assume it's already configured in the Vite project), Lucide React icons, Headless UI or Radix for components, Framer Motion for animations, and React Hook Form for form handling. No backend integration—just mock data with useState/useEffect for a weekly view.

App Structure (single App.tsx):

Header: Fixed top bar with logo "Weekly Timesheet", current week picker (date range display with prev/next buttons), total hours badge (e.g., "40/40h").

Sidebar (left, 250px wide, collapsible on mobile): Profile avatar/initials, navigation: "Dashboard" (active), "Reports", "Settings". Status chips: Draft, Submitted, Approved.

Main Content (flex-fill):

Weekly Header: Gradient bar showing Mon-Sun labels with today highlighted.

Timesheet Gallery: Grid of 7 daily cards (glassmorphism: backdrop-blur, rgba white 0.1 border, rounded-xl shadow-xl). Each card:

Day/Date header.

Project selector (dropdown: "Client A", "Internal", "Admin").

Hours input (number field with validation).

Notes textarea.

Daily total.

Hover: scale 1.05, glow.

Footer Summary: Horizontal bar with project breakdowns, grand total, overtime alert (red if >40h), "Submit for Approval" button (gradient, pulse animation).

Theme: Dark mode base—bg-gradient-to-br from-slate-900 to-slate-800, accent blue-purple gradient (from-indigo-500 to-purple-600). Glass cards: bg-white/10 backdrop-blur-xl border-white/20.

Interactions:

Week picker updates mock data.

Real-time totals recalc on input.

Submit button shows confetti + toast "Submitted!".

Responsive: Mobile stacks sidebar under header, cards become vertical list.

Animations: Fade-in on load, slide-up for cards, button press scale/shrink.

Use shadcn/ui components if possible (assume installed: Button, Input, Select, Card, Badge, etc.). Make it pixel-perfect, production-ready beautiful—copy modern Dribbble timesheet designs. Replace all placeholder content with realistic mock data (e.g., hours: 8, 6, etc.). Export as complete App.tsx ready to paste.

Quick Build Notes
Fully self-contained—no external deps beyond Tailwind/Framer/Lucide. Use TypeScript. Ensure mobile-first responsive with Tailwind breakpoints. Add subtle micro-interactions everywhere for that premium vibe.
